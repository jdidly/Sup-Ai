## No-Liquidation Mechanics

### Revolutionary Design
Unlike traditional perpetuals where positions can be liquidated when losses exceed margin, Superp positions are designed with fixed maximum loss equal to the initial buy-in amount.

### How It Works
```
Traditional Perpetual:
- Buy-in: $100
- Leverage: 100x
- Position Size: $10,000
- Liquidation: If price moves 1% against position
- Maximum Loss: $100+ (can exceed buy-in due to slippage)

Superp No-Liquidation:
- Buy-in: $100
- Leverage: 100x
- Virtual Exposure: $10,000
- No Liquidation: Position expires at timer end
- Maximum Loss: Exactly $100 (buy-in amount only)
```

### Timer-Based Expiration
Instead of liquidation, positions have fixed expiration times:
- **Entry Window**: Minutes 0-3 of 10-minute cycle
- **Mid-Timer**: Minutes 4-6 (leverage efficiency decreases)
- **Late-Timer**: Minutes 7-8 (further leverage reduction)
- **Exit Window**: Minutes 9-10 (automatic position closure)

### Leverage Efficiency Over Time
```python
def calculate_leverage_efficiency(timer_minute, base_leverage):
    if timer_minute <= 3:
        return base_leverage * 1.0    # Full efficiency
    elif timer_minute <= 6:
        return base_leverage * 0.8    # 80% efficiency
    elif timer_minute <= 8:
        return base_leverage * 0.6    # 60% efficiency
    else:
        return base_leverage * 0.4    # 40% efficiency
```
