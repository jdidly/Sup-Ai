## Core Trading Logic

### Revolutionary PSC (Price-Signal-Confidence) Arbitrage
The system identifies arbitrage opportunities by analyzing the relationship between realized and implied volatility across cryptocurrency pairs, particularly focusing on PSC ratios relative to TON for BOTH long and short positions.

### Key Features:
- ✅ **Bidirectional Trading**: Complete LONG + SHORT signal capability
- ✅ **Zero Liquidation Risk**: Maximum loss = buy-in amount only
- ✅ **Continuous ML Monitoring**: 45-second scanning cycles
- ✅ **10-Minute Timer Cycles**: Strict entry windows (minutes 0-3)
- ✅ **Dynamic Leverage**: 1x-10,000x based on confidence and timer position
- ✅ **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**: 1m, 5m, 10m TradingView integration
- ✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: All 6 major coins monitored

## Superp No-Liquidation Technology

### Core Concept
Superp perpetuals eliminate liquidation risk by design. Unlike traditional perpetuals where positions can be forcefully closed, Superp positions can only lose the initial buy-in amount.

### Leverage Categories
```python
class SuperpLeverageType(Enum):
    CONSERVATIVE = (1, 100)      # 1x-100x for low-risk signals
    MODERATE = (100, 1000)       # 100x-1000x for medium confidence  
    AGGRESSIVE = (1000, 5000)    # 1000x-5000x for high confidence
    EXTREME = (5000, 10000)      # 5000x-10000x for maximum confidence
```

### Position Structure
- **Buy-in Amount**: $10-$100 initial investment
- **Virtual Exposure**: Up to $1,000,000 with 10,000x leverage
- **Timer-Based Leverage**: Decreases as time approaches expiration
- **Confidence Scaling**: Higher confidence = higher leverage eligibility

### Timer-Based Leverage Reduction
```
Minutes 0-3: Full leverage available (entry window)
Minutes 4-6: 80% of original leverage
Minutes 7-8: 60% of original leverage  
Minutes 9-10: 40% of original leverage (exit window)
```

## PSC Arbitrage Strategy

### Ratio Calculation
```python
base_ratio = current_price / (ton_price * 0.001)  # Adjusted for scale differences
```

### Bidirectional Signal Logic

#### LONG Signal Criteria
1. **PSC Ratio**: ≥ 1.25 (configurable via `min_signal_ratio`)
2. **Timer Window**: Minutes 0-3 of 10-minute cycle
3. **ML Confidence**: ≥ 60% prediction confidence
4. **TradingView Confirmation**: Technical analysis supports bullish bias
5. **Price Validation**: Real-time price feeds confirmed

#### SHORT Signal Criteria  
1. **PSC Ratio**: ≤ 0.8-0.9 (bearish divergence)
2. **Timer Window**: Minutes 0-3 of 10-minute cycle
3. **ML Confidence**: ≥ 60% prediction confidence for downward movement
4. **TradingView Confirmation**: Technical analysis supports bearish bias
5. **Price Validation**: Real-time price feeds confirmed

### Direction Determination Algorithm
```python
def determine_trade_direction(crypto, ratio, confidence, tradingview_sentiment):
    # LONG Signal Logic
    if ratio >= 2.0 and confidence > 0.7 and tradingview_sentiment >= 0.6:
        return "LONG"  # Strong PSC arbitrage opportunity
    elif ratio >= 1.5 and confidence > 0.6 and tradingview_sentiment >= 0.5:
        return "LONG"  # Good PSC opportunity with TA support
    elif ratio >= 1.25 and confidence > 0.5 and tradingview_sentiment >= 0.4:
        return "LONG"  # Entry-level PSC arbitrage
    
    # SHORT Signal Logic
    elif ratio <= 0.8 and confidence > 0.7 and tradingview_sentiment <= 0.4:
        return "SHORT"  # Strong bearish divergence
    elif ratio <= 0.9 and confidence > 0.6 and tradingview_sentiment <= 0.3:
        return "SHORT"  # Good short opportunity
    elif ratio < 1.0 and confidence > 0.5 and tradingview_sentiment <= 0.2:
        return "SHORT"  # Entry-level short signal
    
    else:
        return "NEUTRAL"  # Mixed signals or insufficient confidence
```

## ML Engine Integration

### Continuous Monitoring System
The ML engine operates independently, providing 45-second market scanning with real sklearn models.

### Enhanced Models
- **Win Predictor**: LogisticRegression with balanced class weights
- **Return Predictor**: GradientBoostingRegressor (200 estimators)
- **Confidence Predictor**: RandomForestRegressor (100 estimators)
- **Ensemble Models**: VotingRegressor for improved accuracy

### Prediction Pipeline
```python
def should_ml_generate_signal(prediction_data):
    # Relaxed criteria for better signal generation
    min_confidence = 0.6      # Reduced from 0.75
    min_return = 0.001        # 0.1% minimum (reduced from 0.15%)
    
    return (prediction_data['confidence'] >= min_confidence and 
            prediction_data['predicted_return'] >= min_return)
```

### Scanning Process
1. **45-Second Cycles**: Independent ML analysis of all monitored coins
2. **TradingView Validation**: Technical analysis confirmation for all signals
3. **Multi-Timeframe**: 1m, 5m, 10m comprehensive analysis
4. **18 Analysis Points**: 6 coins × 3 timeframes every 30 seconds

## Timer-Based Leverage System

### 10-Minute Trading Cycles
All trading operates within strict 10-minute windows:

- **Minutes 0-3**: Entry window (positions can be opened)
- **Minutes 4-6**: Mid-timer (moderate leverage phase)
- **Minutes 7-8**: Late-timer (low leverage phase)
- **Minutes 9-10**: Exit window (positions close automatically)

### Dynamic Leverage Calculation
```python
def calculate_superp_timer_leverage(confidence, psc_ratio, timer_minute, volatility):
    # Base leverage from confidence and ratio
    base_leverage = min(confidence * psc_ratio * 1000, 10000)
    
    # Timer-based reduction
    if timer_minute <= 3:
        time_factor = 1.0      # Full leverage in entry window
    elif timer_minute <= 6:
        time_factor = 0.8      # 80% in mid-timer
    elif timer_minute <= 8:
        time_factor = 0.6      # 60% in late-timer
    else:
        time_factor = 0.4      # 40% in exit window
    
    # Volatility adjustment
    volatility_factor = max(0.5, min(1.5, 1.0 / (volatility + 0.1)))
    
    return base_leverage * time_factor * volatility_factor
```

## TradingView Integration

### Multi-Timeframe Analysis
- **1-Minute**: Short-term momentum and entry timing
- **5-Minute**: Medium-term trend confirmation
- **10-Minute**: Longer-term direction alignment

### Technical Indicators
- **RSI**: Momentum and overbought/oversold conditions
- **MACD**: Trend direction and momentum changes
- **Moving Averages**: Support/resistance and trend confirmation
- **Volume**: Confirmation of price movements

### Signal Validation
Every ML-generated signal requires TradingView confirmation:
- **Bullish Bias**: Technical indicators support upward movement
- **Bearish Bias**: Technical indicators support downward movement
- **Neutral**: Mixed or conflicting technical signals
